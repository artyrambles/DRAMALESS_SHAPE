-- DRAMALESS_SHAPE Voxel Mod: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod, based on the Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod.
--
-- Stahl's Edits version.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Nothing here reaches collision, movement, triggers or scripts.  Voxel
-- mode is purely presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.

-- `ctx.width/height` are the window measured in LOVE UNITS

-- that only covers the window when the canvas is at PIXEL resolution.
-- Sizing it in units costs the DPI scale TWICE: the canvas is that much
-- smaller, then it is drawn that much smaller again, so the diorama lands
-- in the top-left corner at 1/dpi of the screen.  Desktop never sees it --
-- units and pixels are the same thing there -- but on Android the DPI scale
-- is the display density (2.625 on a 420dpi panel), and the world came out
-- a third of the size in each direction.
--
-- So ask for the pixel dimensions rather than trusting the ctx.  That is
-- the number a fixed engine would hand over, so this keeps working either
-- way instead of double-correcting.  It also squares the FX pass: ctx.scale
-- is ALREADY in pixels per world pixel (Zoom.scale over Renderer:fitScale,
-- which measures the drawable), so the closures ctx.drawFx runs were being
-- scaled for a canvas 2.6x bigger than the one they drew into.

-- ------- this mod's hotkeys
--
--   V  VOXEL    cycle the camera ladder      (was 6; skips FULL)
--   G  V-GRID   toggle the wireframe         (new)
--   T  T-SHIFT  cycle the blur ladder        (was 9)
--   C  V-CURVE  cycle the horizon bend       (new)
--   B  3D-BTL   cycle overworld battles      (new)
--   (wip)  WATER    cycle the water reflections  (not properly implemented yet)
--
-- Only V arrives by the documented route. Game:keypressed answers the
-- engine's own display keys FIRST and returns -- 2 COLORS, 3 TILT, 4 ZOOM,
-- 5 GBC FX -- and only then offers the key to Pipelines.hotkey, expressly
-- so "a pipeline can never shadow one" (Schemas, render_pipelines.hotkey).
-- 3 and 5 are two of those, and 7 and 8 belong to plain mod settings that
-- own no pass and so have no registry to claim a key from at all.
--
-- So this wraps Game:keypressed. It is the invasive option and it is the
-- only one: polling the keyboard in update() would fire alongside the
-- engine's handler rather than instead of it, so 3 would cycle this mode
-- AND the engine's TILT on the same press.
--
-- Consequences worth being explicit about: while this mod is enabled, TILT
-- (3) and GBC FX (5) are unreachable by key -- and unreachable on the OPTIONS
-- menu too, where both rows are taken away and both values held at zero (see
-- pinEngineFx). Nothing is being hidden that still does something: TILT is the
-- flat fake of what this mode does for real, the registry already forces it
-- off whenever a world pipeline takes the pass, and GBC FX is a full-screen
-- present pass over the top of the diorama. Uninstalling puts both back.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here
-- too, so the work is DELEGATED rather than reimplemented: Pipelines.hotkey
-- applies its own gate and ladder, and the three lines after it are the
-- engine's own (syncOptions, the tilt exclusion, writeOptions).

-- ------- TILT and GBC FX are gone while this mod is installed
--
-- Both fight the diorama, and both were already half-taken: the mode's own key

-- whenever a world pipeline takes the pass. What was left was two rows the
-- player could set and watch get reverted -- TILT is the flat fake of what
-- this mode does for real, and GBC FX is a full-screen present pass over the
-- top of the whole thing.
--
-- So they come OFF the menu, and are HELD at zero rather than merely dropped.
-- Hiding a live setting is a trap: a save written before the mod was installed
-- can carry TILT 3, and a row that is not there is a row that cannot turn it
-- back off. Pinned wherever the value could have arrived from -- the menu
-- opening, a save being loaded or begun -- so there is no route by which one
-- of them is on and unreachable.
--
-- Everything they did is still reachable: uninstall the mod and both rows are
-- back, at whatever they were last set to.
-- BATTLE BG rides the same reasoning, and comes off for a reason of its own.
-- The row picks what fills the screen AROUND the battle's 160x144 field --
-- WHITE paper, BLACK bars, or the frozen overworld dimmed behind it -- and
-- all three were answers to the same question: what to do with the voids,
-- given the battle is a small picture in the middle of a big window.
--
-- This mod answers that question differently and permanently. A staged fight
-- fills the whole window with the map the fight is standing on, and the
-- flat battle screen it composites over it is drawn on the mode's own
-- surface; there are no voids left for the row to fill. WORLD is the worst
-- of the three under it -- it makes the battle non-opaque so the engine
-- draws the overworld underneath, which is a SECOND copy of the world drawn
-- under the one the arena pass already put there, dimmed and at a different
-- camera. BLACK bars over a diorama read as a letterboxed screenshot.
--
-- So the value is pinned at WHITE, which is the one the mode was composed
-- against, and the row comes off the menu on the same reasoning as TILT and
-- GBC FX: a row that no longer decides anything is worse than no row.
-- Uninstall the mod and it is back, at whatever it was last set to.

--

--   the regrowth restores those blocks when the map is re-entered
--   card-key doors are stamped closed on floor load

-- Map:setBlock -- so wrap that from here instead. Map is a plain
-- metatable shared by every map instance, so this covers all of them,

-- ------- the free-roam rungs' inputs and their walk
--
-- 1ST and 3RD need two things no other rung does, and each is a named seam.
-- Both rungs are one rig -- the boom behind the shoulder is a number inside
-- it (lib/ThirdPerson.lua) -- so both are installed by the same two calls:
--
-- FirstPerson.install claims the LOOK inputs the engine ignores: the right
-- stick's axes (Game:gamepadaxis passes them to Input, which returns early
-- on anything but the left pair), relative mouse motion (love.mousemoved --
-- there is no Game handler to wrap; the engine's own callback only feeds
-- the mouse-as-touch debug path, which stays untouched), the mouse buttons
-- while the cursor is captured (A and B -- there is no cursor to click UI
-- with), and any touch that lands off the overlay's controls (a drag on
-- open screen is the look; the d-pad and buttons still go to
-- TouchControls, whose own d-pad finger is also read back analog as the
-- move vector). Every wrap forwards whatever it does not claim, and claims
-- only while one of the two rungs is actually driving.
--
-- FreeMove.install wraps OverworldState:handleInput -- the one choke point
-- where the grid walk reads the pad, and the same seam the engine's own
-- Cycling Road pull lives behind. While either drives, the walk is continuous
-- and camera-relative; the player's logical cell stays synced and every
-- per-cell consequence still runs through the engine's own machinery
-- (onStepComplete, checkEdgeExit, checkLedgeHop, checkBoulderPush). The
-- file argues the whole arrangement.
FirstPerson.install()
FreeMove.install()

-- ------- the zooms, and the battle camera the player can steer
--
-- CamControl claims the wheel, Q/E, the mouse and the touch screen for
-- whichever camera is actually in front of the player -- the staged
-- battle's, the third-person boom, or the engine's own survey zoom -- and

-- ------- SELECT walks the angle ladder
-- no it doesn't anymore. checkmate atheists.
--
-- The same step the "3" key makes, on the pad's own button: a phone (and
-- a controller) has no number row, and SELECT has no overworld job in
-- Gen 1 -- its work is all in-menu, which this wrap never sees. The seam
-- is OverworldState:handleInput, the same choke point the free walk
-- replaced: every gate above it -- menus, dialogs, scripted moves,
-- transitions -- already decided the overworld owns the buttons, so a
-- SELECT here is free-roam by construction, exactly like the key. When
-- the step is refused (mid-warp, no 3D pass) the press falls through to
-- the engine's own handling, which is a no-op, as ever.
--
-- Installed AFTER FreeMove.install, deliberately: its wrap must sit
-- OUTSIDE the free walk's, or first person -- where FreeMove.tick takes
-- the frame and never calls further in -- would eat the button, and the
-- one rung SELECT could not step off of would be 1ST itself.

-- ------- edge-anchored menus stay in the GB frame while a headset is live
--
-- The engine's zoom-aware anchoring (Renderer:setUIAnchor) docks the START
-- menu to the WINDOW's top-right edge. Both VR screens -- the floating
-- panel and the Pokedex -- crop the window to the GB frame, so a menu at
-- the window's edge is cropped away with the border it docked to. The
-- engine's own answer to "a state composes its screen, keep every element
-- inside it" is uiAnchorHold, computed per frame from this predicate; a
-- live headset is exactly that situation for the WHOLE window, so the
-- predicate answers yes for as long as one is. Held menus blit where they
-- were drawn in the 160x144 canvas -- the START menu's 9,0 x 11 slot is
-- already flush with the frame's right edge, which is the right edge of
-- what the headset sees. Off-headset frames fall through untouched.

-- the black, and the map fades up. The two seams it needs -- BattleState:finish
-- and Renderer:endFrame -- and the reasoning for each live in lib/BattleExit.lua.
--
-- Declared as a transitions record rather than a constant in that file, so the
-- fade is retunable in data exactly like the eight wipes it answers, and a total
-- conversion can make it as long or as short as its own pacing wants.

--
-- The clock reaches the diorama through the voxel shader's own tint uniform,

-- that fell on the diorama left the flat world at permanent noon. One clock,
-- two worlds, one of them ignoring it. DayTint paints the same multiply over
-- the composited flat world, between the world blit and the UI blit; the
-- reasoning for that exact instant is in the file.

-- standing. Written on the engine's save.writing event -- the moment before
-- the bytes hit disk -- and read back whenever a save is opened or begun. A
-- save with no clock in it starts at day; that is DayNight.restore's
-- fallback, and also the DAYTIME row's own default.
